# Digit-recognizer
![Python-Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue?style=flat-square)

A tkinter based GUI Machine learning/Deep learning app that lets you draw digits and then predicts them.

Note : This is my first time building neural nets hence the neural net was trained mostly on default parameters, Once im decent at deep learning ill work more on the neural net in the backend.

The model was trained on the famous MNIST dataset. I've already seen a lot of people train MNIST models but all those models did was perform predictions on the test data and try to increase accuracy. But i decided to take it a little bit further and coded an interface where you can draw a digit and then perform predictions on it
